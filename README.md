# Skin-Bot
Bot for trading skins in CS:GO

We wrote it a long time ago and itâ€™s hard for me to figure out how it works. Good luck!

The idea was to parse the CS:GO skin exchange in an attempt to find special lots: weapons with several stickers. 
The owners of these weapons put up their copies, forgetting about the prices of the stickers, which can significantly increase the price for sale. 
An attempt is made to find such assumptions, and then resell the unique weapons with a markup. Perhaps the milking scheme can work now.

As I remember, I was responsible for parsing, other people were responsible for analysis and visualization
